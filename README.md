Kanban Board App
This is a simple Kanban board application built with Flask and JavaScript.

Description
The Kanban board is a project management tool designed to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency. This application allows users to create tasks, move them between different stages (To-Do, In Progress, Done), and delete them once they're no longer needed.

Each task can be dragged and dropped into different stages, providing an interactive way to manage your projects.
